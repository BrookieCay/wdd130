            I am a retired school teacher and mother of many children. I want to learn how to make a website to go with
            my Family History classes. I graduated from B.Y.U. and taught school in Idaho. I married and our family was
            in the Airforce. I have lived in Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Maryland, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas,
            Oklahoma, New Mexico, Iowa and Nevada again. My children are all grown up, and I visit them all I can. I
            love outdoors and adventure. In Nevada I can show you hidden caves and fossils. I love working with children
            and helping them find the world that they love. I play the guitar and fun piano songs that help make the
            world a fun place to be. My Family History Classes have taught me the adventure of finding hidden
            information about the lives of my ancestors and others I research. I try to remember to write history now
            with living and doing things with my family. I have done stained glass art work, writing, and love to travel
            to see my family. I am currently helping tend a 5 month old grandson each day and learning to make this
            website.
